# Master Plan

## Project Overview
This repository (gwhamer1/test.md) contains an experimental project. This master plan outlines goals, milestones, responsibilities, and success criteria to guide development and collaboration.

## Objectives
- Define a clear Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- Establish a roadmap with measurable milestones.
- Assign responsibilities and set communication norms.
- Track risks and mitigation strategies.
- Define success metrics and a release plan.

## Scope
In scope:
- Core functionality required for the MVP
- Documentation and developer setup
- CI basics and basic tests

Out of scope (for MVP):
- Full performance tuning
- Extensive integrations

## Success Criteria
- Working MVP that demonstrates core functionality.
- Automated tests covering critical paths.
- Documentation sufficient for a new contributor to run the project locally.

## Roadmap & Milestones
1. Discovery & Planning (Week 1)
   - Goals: finalise requirements, design approach, list core features.
   - Output: this masterplan, basic architecture notes.

2. MVP Implementation (Weeks 2-4)
   - Goals: implement core features, basic tests, README and setup.
   - Output: first working release (v0.1.0).

3. Stabilisation & Tests (Weeks 5-6)
   - Goals: improve test coverage, fix bugs, add CI flow.
   - Output: v0.2.0 with CI and tests.

4. Documentation & Onboarding (Week 7)
   - Goals: complete contributor guide, templates for issues and PRs.
   - Output: CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, PR_TEMPLATE.md.

5. Iterate & Scale (Ongoing)
   - Goals: add features, performance improvements, community adoption.

## Milestones Table
- v0.1.0 — MVP (core features implemented)
- v0.2.0 — Tests & CI
- v1.0.0 — First stable release

## Owners & Roles
- Product / Planning: @gwhamer1
- Development: (TBD)
- Documentation: (TBD)
- CI / DevOps: (TBD)

Replace (TBD) with contributor GitHub usernames as they join.

## Tasks (initial)
- [ ] Define core feature list
- [ ] Implement core feature A
- [ ] Implement core feature B
- [ ] Add basic tests
- [ ] Setup CI (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Write README and CONTRIBUTING

## Risks & Mitigation
- Risk: Scope creep — Mitigation: keep strict MVP scope and track new ideas as future issues.
- Risk: Lack of contributors — Mitigation: write clear onboarding docs and small starter tasks.
- Risk: Unclear acceptance criteria — Mitigation: define testable success criteria per feature.

## Communication
- Use GitHub Issues for tracking work and discussion.
- Use PRs for code changes and require at least one review before merging.

## Metrics
- PR cycle time
- Test coverage on critical paths
- Number of open issues by priority

## Next Steps
1. Add this masterplan to the repository.
2. Create an initial issue listing the core features for MVP.
3. Start implementation of the highest-priority feature.
